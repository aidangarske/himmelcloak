//! himmelcloak, native, no-browser authentication against Keycloak.

//! Standalone Rust library for Linux applications using stock Keycloak.

//! `Challenge`/`Answer` variant, a trait signature, or `AuthStep` affects every caller. Per-method
//! modules plug in and must not modify the engine or public types. All crypto goes through `crypto`.

// Stubs are intentionally unused. Remove once modules are implemented.
